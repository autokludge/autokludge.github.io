{"body":"Projects\r\n========\r\nMost of my work on Github is my interest in configuring my development environment.\r\n\r\nI've helped update and create snippets for Marco Monteiro's '[Codeigniter Snippets](https://github.com/mpmont/ci-snippets)' Sublime Text 2 plugin and have also fixed bugs in [aziz/PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks), an interactive TODO list for ST2.\r\n\r\nI have made / published a few other Sublime Text 2 plugins, [Codeigniter Codeintel helper](https://github.com/speilberg0/ci-codeintel-helper) and [Toggle Css Format](https://github.com/speilberg0/SublimeToggleCssFormat).\r\n\r\nWorking from the shell has also been made easier, with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/speilberg0/oh-my-zsh) and a personal theme displaying date and time, user, current branch and commit ref and branch status.","note":"Don't delete this file!
